        <p>Welcome to <strong>RecipeGuru</strong>! We're happy to have you here. In order to maintain a healthy and enjoyable space for everyone, we kindly ask that you follow these community guidelines:</p>

        <ul class="space-y-6">
            <li>
                <strong class="block text-xl text-gray-900">No toxic behavior or hate speech</strong>
                This platform is a safe and welcoming space for everyone. Any form of hateful language, trolling, or attempts to instigate negativity will not be tolerated. Our moderators actively monitor activity, and violations may result in account suspension or removal.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong class="block text-xl text-gray-900">Zero tolerance for discrimination</strong>
                Racism, sexism, homophobia, ableism, or any other form of discriminatory content or language is strictly forbidden. We believe in equality and diversity, and this space must reflect those values.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong class="block text-xl text-gray-900">No harassment or bullying</strong>
                Treat others with the respect you’d expect in return. Personal attacks, threats, or ongoing unwanted contact with another user will result in disciplinary action. This is a platform for support and inspiration—not hostility.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong class="block text-xl text-gray-900">Stay on topic</strong>
                Please keep conversations related to cooking, recipes, and food culture. Off-topic discussions, spam, or unrelated self-promotion disrupt the community experience and may be removed.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong class="block text-xl text-gray-900">Respect others' work</strong>
                All content—photos, recipes, and comments—belongs to the users who post them. Do not steal, repost without credit, or undermine another person's effort. Appreciate and support the contributions of fellow food lovers.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong class="block text-xl text-gray-900">Follow moderator guidance</strong>
                The admin and moderation team is here to ensure fairness and peace. If a moderator contacts you or enforces a rule, please cooperate. Rule-breaking may result in a recipe, comment or even account suspension.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mt-10 text-base text-gray-600">Thank you for being part of the RecipeGuru community. Let’s cook, learn, and share together in a positive environment!</p>
